# Final Project - "Stream of Consciousness" 

For my final project, I wanted to explore the notion that “Everything in the Universe is interconnected” and find a way to express it musically. I wanted to achieve this by triggering samples of sounds found in nature and having them gradually form a pattern where music slowly emerges. 

I started by recording various environmental sounds while hiking up at Mount Doug in Victoria, BC. 
Using Max, I created a patch that would allow me to play the samples as repeating rhythmic phrases, while allowing me to disrupt this pattern by adding delays, time stretching, and changing the start and endpoint of the loop. 

For a melodic element, I used a sample of birds chirping and created a very simple keyboard sampler using the groove~ object. 
For harmony, I used wind sounds and a sample of a plane flying in the distance. The wind sounds were triggered using the MUGIC, and depending on the amount of energy delivered more or less “chordal notes” are played. With the plane sounds, I ended up using the "Quick Sampler" in Logic X Pro, and bouncing out various chords that I later loaded into my Max patch.

My original plan was to have the plane harmonies gradually morph into one another where each pitch leads continuously and smoothly to the next note. I think this would be especially interesting moving from tight closed voicing to open spread voicings. I started a test patch (called “Dynamic_Harmony_test”) and was able to make this work using the groove object while using the MUGIC to direct the transitions. Unfortunately, I did not have enough time to incorporate this into my performance.

This project was challenging and took a lot of careful planning on how to make each part work together. Although I was unable to achieve everything I wanted to originally, I am still proud of the result. I hope to explore this concept in more depth in the future.
