# MaxMSP-Audio-Patches

This repoistory primarily consist of a collection of Max patches I worked on as a part of Mus 407, a Computer Music seminar at the University of Victoria. 

Max is a visual programming language used for music and multimedia projects. It is an effective and versatile tool used by composers, performers, software designers, researchers, and artists to create recordings, performances, and installations.
