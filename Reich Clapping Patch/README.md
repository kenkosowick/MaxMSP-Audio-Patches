#Clapping Music Patch 
A patch created to perform the rhythm combinations found in Steve Reich's 1972 piece "Clapping Music".

I used tables to notate the desired rhythms and used counters to read through the tables and trigger midi notes. The patch includes two tables that are responsible for triggering the two unique midi sounds. The second table is an iTable that rotate the list of notes to the left after playing the figure 4 times. Additionally, a "drunk dial" was added. It controls the delay associated with each of the trigger messages.
